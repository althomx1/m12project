https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,"Similar to analysis paralysis, this misalignment leads to inefficient use of resources and leaves organizations unnecessarily vulnerable."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,"Finally, compliance-driven vulnerability assessments are today more focused on meeting regulatory requirements than they are on improving security posture."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,"While these VM-driven assessments may satisfy auditors, they rarely address the real-world threats that organizations face."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,A crucial step in the shift to Exposure Management involves adding business context to every relevant security operation.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,This is essential in order to align cybersecurity efforts with strategic organizational goals.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,But it is also necessary so that we can shift cybersecurity away from being perceived as a technical exercise and a prevention-driven cost center and toward being a strategic and revenue enabler.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,"By doing so, we can foster more informed decision-making on the security side, while reducing resistance from non-security stakeholders."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,Aligning security objectives with business priorities also minimizes friction.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,"Instead of focusing solely on technical risks, security teams can address questions like which assets are most critical to operations and reputation."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,This level of clarity helps ensure that scarce resources target the most significant risks. (Want to understand more about how to zero-in on business critical assets?

https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,"What's more, traditional security efforts often falter because they ask the wrong questions."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,"The wrong question is: ""How do I eliminate this vulnerability…and the next…and the next?"" The right question would be ""How does this vulnerability affect profitability/product adoption/revenue streams/name your business outcome – and should we even address it?"" By asking the right questions and incorporating business context into security, we transform security from a reactive process into a proactive strategy."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,The shift to Exposure Management bridges the glaring gap between our technical teams and business leaders because it helps us show that security initiatives address the risks that matter most.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,It's no secret that the attack surface has expanded far beyond traditional IT perimeters and that this introduces broader risks and challenges for security organizations.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,"The era of 'just' on-prem systems and networks is long gone – today's attack surface encompasses SaaS platforms, IoT devices, hybrid and remote workforces, complex supply chains, social media, third-party platforms, the dark web, public-facing assets and much, much more."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,"Managing attack surfaces can be overwhelming for security and risk leaders, especially when many are still poorly understood."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,"To address these challenges, security operations managers need to prioritize their efforts by identifying attack surfaces that are easy to access or that hold high-value targets."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,And that's why shifting from vulnerability management to exposure management is a critical step in making this happen.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,This transition begins with improving visibility across all attack surfaces within the digital infrastructure.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,"Key steps include identifying which attack surfaces to include in the program's scope, conducting a gap analysis to uncover areas where existing technologies fall short, and using this information to define requirements for selecting the right vendors."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,These actions lay the foundation for effective attack surface management.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,"Finally, in the ridiculously complex cyber climate we operate in, finding common language to engage with organizational leadership is crucial to the transition from vulnerability management to exposure management."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,Metrics is just such a language.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,It's the best way to align cybersecurity efforts with business objectives and demonstrate the tangible value of exposure management.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,"The key here is to ensure that C-suite executives, who live and breathe business outcomes, get business-driven metrics."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,"Metrics that reflect business-driven insights (such as a reduction of attack surface exposure, a decrease in risk to critical assets, and any operational efficiencies gained), bridge the gap between technical cybersecurity measures and business goals."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,"Validated results, like simulations of attack scenarios or demonstrable reductions in lateral movement potential, are another way to deliver concrete evidence of success and grow leadership confidence."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/want-to-grow-vulnerability-management.html,"As mentioned above, the closer we can tie security operations directly to business outcomes, the more likely leadership is to view cybersecurity as a business enabler rather than a cost center."

https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,Sherlock Holmes is famous for his incredible ability to sort through mounds of information; he removes the irrelevant and exposes the hidden truth.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,"His philosophy is plain yet brilliant: ""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" Rather than following every lead, Holmes focuses on the details that are needed to move him to the solution."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,"In cybersecurity, exposure validation mirrors Holmes' approach: Security teams are usually presented with an overwhelming list of vulnerabilities, yet not every vulnerability presents a real threat."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,"Just as Holmes discards irrelevant clues, security teams must eliminate exposures that are unlikely to be exploited or do not pose significant risks."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,Exposure validation (sometimes called Adversarial Exposure Validation) enables teams to concentrate on the most significant issues and minimize distractions.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,"Similar to Holmes' deductive reasoning, validation of exposures directs organizations toward vulnerabilities that, if unaddressed, have the potential to result in a security breach."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,"So, before going into more technical details, let's answer the main question: Why is checking for exposures important for every organization, regardless of industry and size?"
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,"In cybersecurity, exposure is a vulnerability, misconfiguration, or security gap existing in an organization's IT environment, which could be used by any threat actor."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,"Examples are software vulnerabilities, weak encryption, misconfigured security controls, inadequate access controls, and unpatched assets."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,"Think of these exposures as the holes in your armor- if left unmitigated, they provide an entry point for attackers to infiltrate your systems."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,Exposure validation runs continuous tests to see if the discovered vulnerabilities can actually be exploited and help security teams prioritize the most critical risks.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,"Not all vulnerabilities are created equal, and many can be mitigated by controls already in place or may not be unexploitable in your environment."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,Consider an organization finding a critical SQLi vulnerability in one of its web applications.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,The security team attempts to exploit this vulnerability in a simulated attack scenario - exposure validation.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,They find that all attack variants in the attack are effectively blocked by existing security controls such as web application firewalls (WAFs).
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,This insight allows the team to prioritize other vulnerabilities that are not mitigated by current defenses.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,"Although CVSS and EPSS scores give a theoretical risk based on the score, it does not mirror the real-world exploitability."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,Exposure validation bridges this chasm by simulating actual attack scenarios and turns raw vulnerability data into actionable insight while ensuring teams put in efforts where it matters most.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,Adversarial exposure validation provides crucial context through simulated attacks and testing of security controls.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,"For instance, a financial services firm identifies 1,000 vulnerabilities in its network."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,"If these had not been validated, prioritizing remediation would be daunting."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,"However, with the use of attack simulations, it becomes firm that 90% of those vulnerabilities are mitigated by currently working controls like NGFW, IPS, and EDR."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,The remaining 100 turn out to be immediately exploitable and pose a high risk against critical assets such as customer databases.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,The organization thus can concentrate its resources and time on remedying those 100 high-risk vulnerabilities and achieve dramatic improvement in security.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,Manual validation is no longer feasible in today's complex IT environments—this is where automation becomes essential.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,Why is automation essential for exposure validation?
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,Exposure validation tools include Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) and Penetration Testing Automation.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,"These tools enable the organization to validate exposures at scale by simulating real-world attack scenarios that test security controls against tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,"On the other hand, automation frees up the burden on security teams that are sometimes swamped by the huge volume of vulnerabilities and alerts."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,"By addressing only the most critical exposures, the team is far more efficient and productive; hence, bringing down risks associated with burnout."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,"Despite the advantages, many organizations could be hesitant to establish exposure validation."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,Let's deal with a few common concerns:
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,"While vulnerability management simply identifies weaknesses, exposure validation identifies vulnerabilities that could actually be exploited."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,Resulting in exposure validation helps in prioritizing meaningful risks.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,The biggest return on investment in integrating exposure validation comes when it's done within a Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) program.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,"CTEM consists of five key phases: Scoping, Discovery, Prioritization, Validation, and Mobilization."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,"Each phase plays a critical role; however, the validation phase is particularly important because it separates theoretical risks from real, actionable threats."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,"This is echoed in the 2024 Gartner® Strategic Roadmap for Managing Threat Exposure: what initially appears to be an ""unmanageably large issue"" will quickly become an ""impossible task"" without validation."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,Exposure validation is like Sherlock Holmes' method of deduction—it helps you eliminate the impossible and focus on the critical.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/a-sherlock-holmes-approach-to.html,"Even Mr. Spock echoed this logic, remarking, ""An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" By validating which exposures are exploitable and which are mitigated by existing controls, organizations can prioritize remediation and strengthen their security posture efficiently."

https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-os-downgrade.html,"""This bypass allows loading unsigned kernel drivers, enabling attackers to deploy custom rootkits that can neutralize security controls, hide processes and network activity, maintain stealth, and much more,"" SafeBreach researcher Alon Leviev said in a report shared with The Hacker News."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-os-downgrade.html,The latest findings build on an earlier analysis that uncovered two privilege escalation flaws in the Windows update process (CVE-2024-21302 and CVE-2024-38202) that could be weaponized to rollback an up-to-date Windows software to an older version containing unpatched security vulnerabilities.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-os-downgrade.html,"The exploit materialized in the form of a tool dubbed Windows Downdate, which, per Leviev, could be used to hijack the Windows Update process to craft fully undetectable, persistent, and irreversible downgrades on critical OS components."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-os-downgrade.html,"This can have severe ramifications, as it offers attackers a better alternative to Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) attacks, permitting them to downgrade first-party modules, including the OS kernel itself."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-os-downgrade.html,"Microsoft subsequently addressed CVE-2024-21302 and CVE-2024-38202 on August 13 and October 8, 2024, respectively, as part of Patch Tuesday updates."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-os-downgrade.html,"The latest approach devised by Leviev leverages the Windows Downdate tool to downgrade the ""ItsNotASecurityBoundary"" DSE bypass patch on a fully updated Windows 11 system."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-os-downgrade.html,"ItsNotASecurityBoundary was first documented by Elastic Security Labs researcher Gabriel Landau in July 2024 alongside PPLFault, describing them as a new bug class codenamed False File Immutability."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-os-downgrade.html,Microsoft remediated it earlier this May.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-os-downgrade.html,"In a nutshell, it exploits a race condition to replace a verified security catalog file with a malicious version containing authenticode signature for an unsigned kernel driver, following which the attacker prompts the kernel to load the driver."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-os-downgrade.html,"Microsoft's code integrity mechanism, which authenticates a file using the kernel mode library ci.dll, then parses the rogue security catalog to validate the signature of the driver and load it, effectively granting the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code in the kernel."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-os-downgrade.html,"The DSE bypass is achieved by making use of the downgrade tool to replace the ""ci.dll"" library with an older version (10.0.22621.1376) to undo the patch put in place by Microsoft."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-os-downgrade.html,"That having said, there is a security barrier that can prevent such a bypass from being successful."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-os-downgrade.html,"If Virtualization-Based Security (VBS) is running on the targeted host, the catalog scanning is carried out by the Secure Kernel Code Integrity DLL (skci.dll), as opposed to ci.dll."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-os-downgrade.html,"However, It's worth noting that the default configuration is VBS without a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) lock."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-os-downgrade.html,"As a result, an attacker could turn it off by tampering with the EnableVirtualizationBasedSecurity and RequirePlatformSecurityFeatures registry keys."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-os-downgrade.html,"Even in cases where UEFI lock is enabled, the attacker could disable VBS by replacing one of the core files with an invalid counterpart."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-os-downgrade.html,"Ultimately, the exploitation steps an attacker needs to follow are below -"
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-os-downgrade.html,"The only instance where it fails is when VBS is turned on with a UEFI lock and a ""Mandatory"" flag, the last of which causes boot failure when VBS files are corrupted."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-os-downgrade.html,The Mandatory mode is enabled manually by means of a registry change.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-os-downgrade.html,"""The Mandatory setting prevents the OS loader from continuing to boot in case the Hypervisor, Secure Kernel, or one of their dependent modules fails to load,"" Microsoft notes in its documentation. ""Special care should be used before enabling this mode, since, in case of any failure of the virtualization modules, the system will refuse to boot."""
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-os-downgrade.html,"Thus, in order to fully mitigate the attack, it's essential that VBS is enabled with UEFI lock and the Mandatory flag set."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-os-downgrade.html,"In any other mode, it makes it possible for an adversary to turn the security feature off, perform the DLL downgrade, and achieve a DSE bypass."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-os-downgrade.html,"""The main takeaway [...] is that security solutions should try to detect and prevent downgrade procedures even for components that do not cross defined security boundaries,"" Leviev told The Hacker News."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-os-downgrade.html,"When reached for comment, Microsoft said it's developing a security update that will revoke outdated, unpatched VBS system files to mitigate this threat, but noted that ""due to the complexity of blocking such a large quantity of files, rigorous testing is required to avoid integration failures or regressions."""

https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a security flaw impacting Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Development Kit (CDK) that could have resulted in an account takeover under specific circumstances.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"""The impact of this issue could, in certain scenarios, allow an attacker to gain administrative access to a target AWS account, resulting in a full account takeover,"" Aqua researchers Ofek Itach and Yakir Kadkoda said in a report shared with The Hacker News."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"Following responsible disclosure on June 27, 2024, the issue was addressed by the project maintainers in CDK version 2.149.0 released in July."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"AWS CDK is an open-source software development framework for defining cloud application resources using Python, TypeScript, or JavaScript and provisioning them via CloudFormation."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"The problem identified by Aqua builds upon prior findings from the cloud security firm about shadow resources in AWS, and how predefined naming conventions for AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets could be weaponized to orchestrate Bucket Monopoly attacks and gain access to sensitive data."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"Preparing an AWS environment for usage with the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is accomplished by a process called bootstrapping, wherein certain AWS resources are provisioned to the environment."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"This includes an AWS S3 bucket, Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) repository, and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"""Resources and their configuration that are used by the CDK are defined in an AWS CloudFormation template,"" according to AWS documentation."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"""To bootstrap an environment, you use the AWS CDK Command Line Interface (AWS CDK CLI) cdk bootstrap command."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"The CDK CLI retrieves the template and deploys it to AWS CloudFormation as a stack, known as the bootstrap stack."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"By default, the stack name is CDKToolkit."""
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"Some of the IAM roles created as part of the bootstrapping process grant permission to upload and delete assets from the associated S3 bucket, as well as perform stack deployments with administrator access."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"Aqua said the naming pattern of the IAM roles created by AWS CDK follows the structure ""cdk-{Qualifier}-{Description}-{Account-ID}-{Region},"" where each of the fields are explained below -"
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"In a similar vein, the S3 bucket created during bootstrapping follows the naming pattern ""cdk-{Qualifier}-assets-{Account-ID}-{Region}."""
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"""Since many users run the cdk bootstrap command without customizing the qualifier, the S3 bucket naming pattern of the staging bucket becomes predictable,"" Aqua said. ""This is because the default value for the bucket name qualifier is set to 'hnb659fds,' making it easier to anticipate the bucket's name."""
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"With thousands of instances discovered on GitHub where the default qualifier is used, this also means that guessing the bucket's name is as simple as finding the AWS Account ID and the region to which the CDK is deployed."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"Combining this aspect with the fact that S3 bucket names are globally unique across all AWS accounts, the loophole opens the door for what's called S3 Bucket Namesquatting (or Bucket Sniping), allowing an attacker to claim another user's CDK bucket if it doesn't exist already."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"This could then pave the way for a partial denial-of-service (DoS) when a user attempts to bootstrap the CDK with the same account ID and region, a scenario that could be resolved by specifying a custom qualifier during bootstrapping."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"A more serious consequence could occur if the victim's CDK has permission to both read and write data from and to the attacker-controlled S3 bucket, thereby making it possible to tamper with CloudFormation templates and execute malicious actions within the victim's AWS account."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"""The deploy role of the CloudFormation service, which is the role CloudFormationExecutionRole in CDK, has administrative privileges within the account by default,"" Aqua pointed out."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"""This means that any CloudFormation template written to the attacker's S3 bucket by the victim's CDK would be deployed later with administrative privileges in the victim's account."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"This would allow the attacker to create privileged resources."""
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"In a hypothetical attack, should a user have initiated the CDK bootstrap process in the past and subsequently deleted the S3 bucket due to quota limits, an adversary could take advantage of the situation to create a bucket with the same name."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"This could then cause the CDK to implicitly trust the rogue bucket and read/write CloudFormation templates to it, making them susceptible to exploitation."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"However, for this to succeed, the attacker is expected to fulfil the below prerequisites -"
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"In the final stage, when the user deploys the CDK using ""cdk deploy,"" not only does the process send the template to the replica bucket, but also inject an admin role that the attacker can assume to ultimately gain control of the victim's account."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"Put differently, the attack chain facilitates the creation of an admin role in a target AWS account when a CDK S3 bucket set up during the bootstrap process is deleted and the CDK is used again."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,AWS has since confirmed that approximately 1% of CDK users were vulnerable to the attack vector.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,The fix put in place by AWS ensures that assets are only uploaded to buckets within the user's account so as to prevent the CDK from pushing data to buckets not owned by the account that launched the bootstrapping.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"It has also urged customers to use a bespoke qualifier instead of the default ""hnb659fds."""
https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html,"In a statement shared with The Hacker News, AWS said investigated and addressed all concerns related to unauthorized data exposure when carrying out CDK deployments."

https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,The most dangerous vulnerability you've never heard of.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,"In the world of cybersecurity, vulnerabilities are discovered so often, and at such a high rate, that it can be very difficult to keep up with."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,"Some vulnerabilities will start ringing alarm bells within your security tooling, while others are far more nuanced, but still pose an equally dangerous threat."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,"Today, we want to discuss one of these more nuanced vulnerabilities as it is likely lurking in your environment waiting to be exploited: Active Directory Certificate Services vulnerabilities."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,vPenTest by Vonahi Security recently implemented an attack vector specifically designed to identify and mitigate these hidden AD CS threats.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,"But first, let's explore why AD CS vulnerabilities are so dangerous and how they work."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,"Active Directory Certificate Services (""AD CS""), as defined by Microsoft is, ""a Windows Server role for issuing and managing public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates used in secure communication and authentication protocols."" Some common features and services that rely on AD CS are:"
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,"As companies continue to increase the variety of technologies available within their organizations, AD CS will become more common and more necessary, especially as companies continue to host their services in the cloud."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,"Many AWS, Azure and GCP services require certificate-based authentication to function, so it is expected that AD CS will become an increasingly prominent and required service in modern multi-cloud networks."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,"As with all powerful tools, there is a responsibility to maintain these tools properly, as they can very often be misused without the proper safeguards."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,This is indeed the case with AD CS.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,"Since AD CS is a core component of the modern Windows and Active Directory authentication and authorization framework, any vulnerabilities that exist pose a great risk to those environments."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,"As we saw 6-7 years ago with Kerberos, and continue to see today, if key authentication infrastructure is compromised, it can be abused to great lengths."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,"The same is the case with AD CS, if not to a greater extent."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,"AD CS attacks rely on the fact that the domain trusts the Certificate Authority (""CA"") server as much as it trusts its Kerberos servers and other identity servers."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,Think of the CA server as a gatekeeper.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,"Just as a gatekeeper controls access to a secure area, the CA server controls the distribution and validation of certificates, ensuring that only trusted entities can gain access."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,"However, AD CS attacks leverage this fact in order to circumvent the need for things like passwords or encryption keys."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,There are four major classes of AD CS vulnerabilities:
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,"Critically worth noting is that, while Microsoft does track and have patches released for the AD CS vulnerabilities that have been assigned CVEs, for the majority of these vulnerabilities, Microsoft puts the onus of repair and security on the consumer, which leads to the presence of these vulnerabilities much more often."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,The most dangerous of the AD CS vulnerability categories is the ESC category (ESC as in privilege escalation).
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,"These pose the greatest threat to the user's environment as they require little to no privileges, depending on the specific misconfiguration."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,"One such misconfiguration is the ESC2 vulnerability, which occurs from a server's need to impersonate certain users under particular circumstances."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,This attack allows a standard user to enroll for a certificate by impersonating them via the request's on-behalf-of field.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,"By doing this, a standard low privileged user can pretend they are the domain administrator and request certificates, and later their NTLM hash, resulting in full compromise of the domain administrator account, and typically the whole domain."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,"Check out the demo to see how an attacker might exploit this by using the AD CS hacking tool, Certipy."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,"As discussed, Microsoft does not have patches that make fixing or identifying these vulnerabilities easy for their users, so the responsibility falls on the users of AD CS to secure their own systems, which can be challenging."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,"So, what to do?"
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,"Built by the discoverers of this vulnerability class, https://github.com/GhostPack/PSPKIAudit is a PowerShell framework designed to do a lot of the heavy lifting for you and identify any offending vulnerabilities in the AD CS configuration."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/breaking-down-ad-cs-vulnerabilities.html,"However, even if you do rule out these vulnerabilities at one point in time, they may resurface alongside the addition of new tools to the environment."

https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/russian-hackers-exploit-safari-and.html,"""When visited with an iPhone or iPad device, the watering hole sites used an iframe to serve a reconnaissance payload, which performed validation checks before ultimately downloading and deploying another payload with the WebKit exploit to exfiltrate browser cookies from the device,"" Google said."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/russian-hackers-exploit-safari-and.html,"The payload is a cookie stealer framework that Google TAG previously detailed in connection with the 2021 exploitation of an iOS zero-day (CVE-2021-1879) to harvest authentication cookies from several popular websites, including Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn, Facebook, Yahoo, GitHub, and Apple iCloud, and send them via WebSocket to an attacker-controlled IP address."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/russian-hackers-exploit-safari-and.html,"""The victim would need to have a session open on these websites from Safari for cookies to be successfully exfiltrated,"" Google noted at the time, adding ""attackers used LinkedIn messaging to target government officials from western European countries by sending them malicious links."""
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/russian-hackers-exploit-safari-and.html,"The fact that the cookie stealer module also singles out the website ""webmail.mfa.gov[.]mn"" suggests that Mongolian government employees were a likely target of the iOS campaign."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/russian-hackers-exploit-safari-and.html,The mfa.gov[.]mn website was infected a third time in July 2024 to inject JavScript code that redirected Android users using Chrome to a malicious link that served an exploit chain combining the flaws CVE-2024-5274 and CVE-2024-4671 to deploy a browser information stealing payload.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/russian-hackers-exploit-safari-and.html,"In particular, the attack sequence uses CVE-2024-5274 to compromise the renderer and CVE-2024-4671 to achieve a sandbox escape vulnerability, ultimately making it possible to break out of Chrome site isolation protections and deliver a stealer malware that can pilfer cookies, passwords, credit card data, browser history, and trust tokens."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/russian-hackers-exploit-safari-and.html,"""This campaign delivers a simple binary deleting all Chrome Crash reports and exfiltrating the following Chrome databases back to the track-adv[.]com server – similar to the basic final payload seen in the earlier iOS campaigns,"" Google TAG noted."

https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/russian-hackers-exploit-safari-and.html,"What's more, the exploit for CVE-2024-4671 is said to share similarities with a previous Chrome sandbox escape that Intellexa was discovered as using in the wild in connection with another Chrome flaw CVE-2021-37973, which was addressed by Google in September 2021."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/russian-hackers-exploit-safari-and.html,"While it's currently not clear how the attackers managed to acquire the exploits for the three flaws, the findings make it amply clear that nation-state actors are using n-day exploits that were originally used as zero-days by CSVs."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/russian-hackers-exploit-safari-and.html,"It, however, raises the possibility that the exploits may have been procured from a vulnerability broker who previously sold them to the spyware vendors as zero-days, a steady supply of which keeps the ball rolling as Apple and Google shore up defenses."

https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/researchers-identify-over-20-supply.html,Cybersecurity researchers are warning about the security risks in the machine learning (ML) software supply chain following the discovery of more than 20 vulnerabilities that could be exploited to target MLOps platforms.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/researchers-identify-over-20-supply.html,"These vulnerabilities, which are described as inherent- and implementation-based flaws, could have severe consequences, ranging from arbitrary code execution to loading malicious datasets."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/researchers-identify-over-20-supply.html,"MLOps platforms offer the ability to design and execute an ML model pipeline, with a model registry acting as a repository used to store and version-trained ML models."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/researchers-identify-over-20-supply.html,These models can then be embedded within an application or allow other clients to query them using an API (aka model-as-a-service).
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/researchers-identify-over-20-supply.html,"""Inherent vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities that are caused by the underlying formats and processes used in the target technology,"" JFrog researchers said in a detailed report."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/researchers-identify-over-20-supply.html,"Some examples of inherent vulnerabilities include abusing ML models to run code of the attacker's choice by taking advantage of the fact that models support automatic code execution upon loading (e.g., Pickle model files)."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/researchers-identify-over-20-supply.html,"This behavior also extends to certain dataset formats and libraries, which allow for automatic code execution, thereby potentially opening the door to malware attacks when simply loading a publicly-available dataset."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/researchers-identify-over-20-supply.html,"Another instance of inherent vulnerability concerns JupyterLab (formerly Jupyter Notebook), a web-based interactive computational environment that enables users to execute blocks (or cells) of code and view the corresponding results."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/researchers-identify-over-20-supply.html,"""An inherent issue that many do not know about, is the handling of HTML output when running code blocks in Jupyter,"" the researchers pointed out. ""The output of your Python code may emit HTML and [JavaScript] which will be happily rendered by your browser."""
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/researchers-identify-over-20-supply.html,"The problem here is that the JavaScript result, when run, is not sandboxed from the parent web application and that the parent web application can automatically run arbitrary Python code."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/researchers-identify-over-20-supply.html,"In other words, an attacker could output a malicious JavaScript code such that it adds a new cell in the current JupyterLab notebook, injects Python code into it, and then executes it."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/researchers-identify-over-20-supply.html,This is particularly true in cases when exploiting a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/researchers-identify-over-20-supply.html,"To that end, JFrog said it identified an XSS flaw in MLFlow (CVE-2024-27132, CVSS score: 7.5) that stems from a lack of sufficient sanitization when running an untrusted recipe, resulting in client-side code execution in JupyterLab."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/researchers-identify-over-20-supply.html,"""One of our main takeaways from this research is that we need to treat all XSS vulnerabilities in ML libraries as potential arbitrary code execution, since data scientists may use these ML libraries with Jupyter Notebook,"" the researchers said."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/researchers-identify-over-20-supply.html,"The second set of flaws relate to implementation weaknesses, such as lack of authentication in MLOps platforms, potentially permitting a threat actor with network access to obtain code execution capabilities by abusing the ML Pipeline feature."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/researchers-identify-over-20-supply.html,"These threats aren't theoretical, with financially motivated adversaries abusing such loopholes, as recently observed in the case of cyber attacks targeting unpatched Anyscale Ray (CVE-2023-48022, CVSS score: 9.8) instances, to deploy cryptocurrency miners."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/researchers-identify-over-20-supply.html,A second type of implementation vulnerability is a container escape targeting Seldon Core that enables attackers to go beyond code execution to move laterally across the cloud environment and access other users' models and datasets by uploading a malicious model to the inference server.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/researchers-identify-over-20-supply.html,"The net outcome of chaining these vulnerabilities is that they could not only be weaponized to infiltrate and spread inside an organization, but also compromise servers."

""However an attacker only has partial control over the filename."""
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/critical-flaws-in-traccar-gps-system.html,"The issues have to do with how the program handles device image file uploads, effectively allowing an attacker to overwrite certain files on the file system and trigger code execution."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/critical-flaws-in-traccar-gps-system.html,This includes files matching the below naming format -
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/critical-flaws-in-traccar-gps-system.html,"In a hypothetical proof-of-concept (PoC) devised by Horizon3.ai, an adversary can exploit the path traversal in the Content-Type header to upload a crontab file and obtain a reverse shell on the attacker host."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/critical-flaws-in-traccar-gps-system.html,"This attack method, however, does not work on Debian/Ubuntu-based Linux systems due to file naming restrictions that bar crontab files from having periods or double quotes."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/critical-flaws-in-traccar-gps-system.html,An alternative mechanism entails taking advantage of Traccar being installed as a root-level user to drop a kernel module or configuring an udev rule to run an arbitrary command every time a hardware event is raised.
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/critical-flaws-in-traccar-gps-system.html,"On susceptible Windows instances, remote code execution could also be achieved by placing a shortcut (LNK) file named ""device.lnk"" in the C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp folder, which gets subsequently executed when any victim user logs into the Traccar host."
https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/critical-flaws-in-traccar-gps-system.html,"Traccar versions 5.1 to 5.12 are vulnerable to CVE-2024-31214 and CVE-2024-2809. The issues have been addressed with the release of Traccar 6 in April 2024 which turns off self-registration by default, thereby reducing the attack surface."
