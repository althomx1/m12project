It surprises nobody that traditional Vulnerability Management solutions struggle to keep up with the challenges of cybersecurity today.,0.008606426626910468
There are a few specific reasons for this; Vulnerability management is a challenge owing to its wide scope of stakeholders who impact and interface with it.,0.006768091609721916
Another key challenge is simply the sheer volume of vulnerabilities identified.,0.008850455547209535

This is essential in order to align cybersecurity efforts with strategic organizational goals.,0.011810159467555592

And that's why shifting from vulnerability management to exposure management is a critical step in making this happen.,0.009053997094862432
This transition begins with improving visibility across all attack surfaces within the digital infrastructure.,0.008213463116328867

Some common features and services that rely on AD CS are:",0.01732829319601481
"As companies continue to increase the variety of technologies available within their organizations, AD CS will become more common and more necessary, especially as companies continue to host their services in the cloud.",0.012168232957348923
"Many AWS, Azure and GCP services require certificate-based authentication to function, so it is expected that AD CS will become an increasingly prominent and required service in modern multi-cloud networks.",0.01082695258385935
"As with all powerful tools, there is a responsibility to maintain these tools properly, as they can very often be misused without the proper safeguards.",0.00883323917436396
This is indeed the case with AD CS.,0.009888045322683281
"Since AD CS is a core component of the modern Windows and Active Directory authentication and authorization framework, any vulnerabilities that exist pose a great risk to those environments.",0.006020716394525838
"As we saw 6-7 years ago with Kerberos, and continue to see today, if key authentication infrastructure is compromised, it can be abused to great lengths.",0.009331339335354127
"The same is the case with AD CS, if not to a greater extent.",0.009580607020149623

"One such misconfiguration is the ESC2 vulnerability, which occurs from a server's need to impersonate certain users under particular circumstances.",0.005702540420986724
