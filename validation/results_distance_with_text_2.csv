It surprises nobody that traditional Vulnerability Management solutions struggle to keep up with the challenges of cybersecurity today.,0.025069785853728765
There are a few specific reasons for this; Vulnerability management is a challenge owing to its wide scope of stakeholders who impact and interface with it.,0.016662402474717175
Another key challenge is simply the sheer volume of vulnerabilities identified.,0.02083152383568221

"Just as Holmes discards irrelevant clues, security teams must eliminate exposures that are unlikely to be exploited or do not pose significant risks.",0.023839514842870835

The biggest return on investment in integrating exposure validation comes when it's done within a Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) program.,0.025782677697939738
"CTEM consists of five key phases: Scoping, Discovery, Prioritization, Validation, and Mobilization.",0.022228678539499835
"Each phase plays a critical role; however, the validation phase is particularly important because it separates theoretical risks from real, actionable threats.",0.02486679785152779

"Active Directory Certificate Services (""AD CS""), as defined by Microsoft is, ""a Windows Server role for issuing and managing public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates used in secure communication and authentication protocols."" Some common features and services that rely on AD CS are:",0.029312465821885958
"As companies continue to increase the variety of technologies available within their organizations, AD CS will become more common and more necessary, especially as companies continue to host their services in the cloud.",0.028312922010931718
"Many AWS, Azure and GCP services require certificate-based authentication to function, so it is expected that AD CS will become an increasingly prominent and required service in modern multi-cloud networks.",0.031696749278729563
"As with all powerful tools, there is a responsibility to maintain these tools properly, as they can very often be misused without the proper safeguards.",0.02671762415318868
This is indeed the case with AD CS.,0.013959068995099577
"Since AD CS is a core component of the modern Windows and Active Directory authentication and authorization framework, any vulnerabilities that exist pose a great risk to those environments.",0.025105480814811343
"As we saw 6-7 years ago with Kerberos, and continue to see today, if key authentication infrastructure is compromised, it can be abused to great lengths.",0.02379048360636349
"The same is the case with AD CS, if not to a greater extent.",0.016791631664207274

"Just as a gatekeeper controls access to a secure area, the CA server controls the distribution and validation of certificates, ensuring that only trusted entities can gain access.",0.0278422937694347
"However, AD CS attacks leverage this fact in order to circumvent the need for things like passwords or encryption keys.",0.01679148841616085
There are four major classes of AD CS vulnerabilities:,0.007483403932076582
"Critically worth noting is that, while Microsoft does track and have patches released for the AD CS vulnerabilities that have been assigned CVEs, for the majority of these vulnerabilities, Microsoft puts the onus of repair and security on the consumer, which leads to the presence of these vulnerabilities much more often.",0.023275632970147453
The most dangerous of the AD CS vulnerability categories is the ESC category (ESC as in privilege escalation).,0.013886373812039832
"These pose the greatest threat to the user's environment as they require little to no privileges, depending on the specific misconfiguration.",0.018703323614221223
"One such misconfiguration is the ESC2 vulnerability, which occurs from a server's need to impersonate certain users under particular circumstances.",0.016564187989817514
This attack allows a standard user to enroll for a certificate by impersonating them via the request's on-behalf-of field.,0.01420075724224712
